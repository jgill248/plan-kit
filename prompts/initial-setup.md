read these: @.cursor/ and these @.specify/

**Cursor**

I'll list the two attached directories to see their contents, then I'll read their subdirectories. Running directory listings now.

I'll read the first batch of five files from `.cursor/commands`. Then I'll run three more parallel batches to read the remaining files.

I'll read the constitution and all template files in `.specify/templates` now.

Progress: I read every file under `.cursor/commands/` and `.specify/` (templates, scripts, memory). Below is a concise inventory and a few small excerpts so you can spot-check content — no files were modified.

- **Files under** `/.cursor/commands/`:
  - `analyze.md` — analysis/report generation for spec/plan/tasks (non-destructive).
  - `clarify.md` — interactive clarifications workflow (max 5 questions, writes clarifications back to spec).
  - `constitution.md` — create/update project constitution; propagation rules.
  - `implement.md` — executes tasks.md implementation plan (phase-driven).
  - `plan.md` — generate implementation plan (Phase 0..2 guidance).
  - `specify.md` — create/update feature spec from a natural-language description.
  - `tasks.md` — generate dependency-ordered `tasks.md` from design docs.

```1:3:d:/_source/agility-speckit/.cursor/commands/analyze.md
---
description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.
---
```

```1:6:d:/_source/agility-speckit/.cursor/commands/specify.md
---
description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.
---
```

- **Files under** `/.specify/`:
  - `memory/constitution.md` — constitution template with placeholder tokens (principles, governance, versioning).
  - `templates/`:
    - `agent-file-template.md` — agent context / development guidelines template.
    - `plan-template.md` — implementation plan template (Phase 0..2 + constitution checks).
    - `spec-template.md` — feature spec template with mandatory sections and review checklist.
    - `tasks-template.md` — tasks template and generation rules (T001..).
  - `scripts/bash/`:
    - `check-prerequisites.sh`, `common.sh`, `create-new-feature.sh`, `setup-plan.sh`, `update-agent-context.sh` — helper scripts the command docs expect to run and parse JSON output from.

```1:9:d:/_source/agility-speckit/.specify/templates/spec-template.md
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
```

```1:8:d:/_source/agility-speckit/.specify/templates/plan-template.md
# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
```

- Quick notes from reading:
  - The command docs consistently require running specific `.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh` scripts and parsing JSON output to discover `FEATURE_DIR` / file paths.
  - The constitution is a template with bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`) and expects precise replacement/validation when updated.
  - The workflow enforces gates: e.g., `clarify` before `plan` if NEEDS_CLARIFICATION remains; `plan` stops before generating tasks; `/tasks` creates `tasks.md`; `/analyze` runs after `/tasks`.

Next steps I can take (choose one):
- Open any specific file to show more lines or the full content.
- Run a check for the executable scripts referenced (verify they exist and are runnable).
- Summarize any one command’s full execution steps in plain language.

No edits were made.

- **Summary**:
  - Read and indexed all files in `/.cursor/commands/` and `/.specify/` (templates, memory, scripts).
  - Confirmed required scripts and gate-based workflows are documented in the command files.
  - Nothing changed on disk. Which file or command do you want me to inspect in more detail next?

ok, i want to build a react app, nestjs api, and postgresql database. i want to create it a number of steps. we will use the nx workspace for this, so the could should end up living in a src folder. the root folder should contain a docker compose file for postgres and any other tool we might id. let's create a high level plan. the plan should be proper project planning, using files similar to what the .cursor files and the .specifiy folder might create, this will be at a higher level, talking about discussing the ideas, identifiyng the features, structure the code, build the database, etc.

this is what i expect to see. a folder called plan. in that folder there should be a plan.md. that file will contain high level information about the plan. but not go into detail for a given section. that should be done in other files. i will let you pick the name of those files, make it make sense, but they must be .md files.

I'll create a todo list for this multi-step plan, then add the `plan/` folder with the requested Markdown files and a root `docker-compose.yml`. I'll run a linter check on the new files and then mark the todos completed.

title: High-level plan for NX monorepo with React, NestJS, and PostgreSQL
created: 2025-09-26
---

This repository will be organized as an NX workspace under `src/` and will contain a React frontend, a NestJS backend API, and a PostgreSQL database coordinated via `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root. The plan is split into several concise companion documents (architecture, features, database, devops) that capture the details for each area while keeping `plan.md` a high-level overview.

Goals
- Establish a maintainable monorepo using NX
- Deliver a production-ready default project layout for frontend, backend, and database
- Provide reproducible local development via Docker Compose
- Enforce TDD and CI checks by default

Milestones (high-level)
- M1: Workspace scaffolding (NX workspace, src layout, root tooling)
- M2: API + DB baseline (NestJS app, migrations, db container)
- M3: Frontend baseline (React app, example page, API integration)
- M4: Tests & CI (unit, integration, contract tests, Dockerized test DB)
- M5: Polish & docs (quickstart, environment docs, observability)

Deliverables
- `plan/architecture.md` — NX workspace layout and rationale
- `plan/features.md` — feature list, user stories, and acceptance criteria
- `plan/database.md` — schema overview, migration strategy, and seeds
- `plan/devops.md` — `docker-compose` definitions, env conventions, CI notes
- `docker-compose.yml` (repo root) — Postgres service and helper tooling

Constraints & Assumptions
- Development platform: Node 18+ (LTS), Docker for local development
- Primary languages: TypeScript for frontend and backend
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+
- The `src/` directory will contain all source code and NX apps/libs

Next steps
1. Review and approve high-level plan
2. Generate NX workspace and create `apps/frontend`, `apps/api`, `libs/`
3. Wire up docker-compose and initial migration tooling


```

title: Architecture & Workspace Layout
---

Overview
- We will use NX to manage a TypeScript monorepo. The `src/` directory will contain `apps/` and `libs/` following NX conventions. Apps will be:
  - `apps/frontend` — React application (Vite or Next.js depending on SSR needs; default: CRA/Vite for simplicity)
  - `apps/api` — NestJS REST API (TypeScript)

Libraries
- `libs/shared` — DTOs, types, and shared utils used by both frontend and backend
- `libs/db` — database access layer, entities, and migration utilities
- `libs/ui` — shared UI components (optional)

Tooling
- Node 18+; TypeScript; ESLint; Prettier; Jest/Playwright
- NX task orchestration for building, serving, linting, and testing

Source layout (top-level)
```
src/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── api/
└── libs/
    ├── shared/
    ├── db/
    └── ui/
```

Rationale
- Monorepo enables sharing DTOs and types between frontend and backend reducing duplication and integration errors.
- NX provides caching, task orchestration, and efficient builds for large workspaces.

CI/CD note
- CI pipelines should run tests in parallel per app and use NX affected graph to minimize work.

title: Features and User Stories
---

Overview
- This document lists the initial feature set and user stories for the first release. Each story includes a brief acceptance criterion.

Core Features
1. User management
   - As a user, I can register an account, log in, and log out.
   - Acceptance: Users can create an account and authenticate; JWT tokens issued by API.

2. Profile management
   - As a user, I can update my profile information and upload an avatar.
   - Acceptance: Changes persist in DB; avatar upload stores file reference.

3. Simple resource CRUD (e.g., Notes)
   - As a user, I can create, read, update, and delete notes tied to my account.
   - Acceptance: Notes are scoped to user and accessible via API and frontend.

4. Authorization rules
   - As the system, only the owner can modify their resources.
   - Acceptance: API returns 403 for unauthorized modifications.

Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: p95 API latency < 200ms under baseline test load
- Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt; JWTs signed with RS256
- Observability: Request logs and basic metrics (requests/sec, error rate)

Edge Cases
- Rate limits for create endpoints
- Handling partial failures during file upload

Roadmap & Prioritization
- Phase 1: Auth + User CRUD + DB schema
- Phase 2: Notes CRUD + UI integration
- Phase 3: Polish, tests, and deployment


```

title: Database Schema & Migrations
---

Overview
- PostgreSQL will be used as the primary relational datastore. Migrations will be managed with `knex`, `typeorm`, or `prisma` (recommendation: Prisma for DX and TypeScript-first models).

Entities (initial)
- `users`:
  - id (uuid, PK)
  - email (unique)
  - password_hash
  - display_name
  - avatar_url
  - created_at, updated_at

- `notes`:
  - id (uuid, PK)
  - user_id (FK -> users.id)
  - title
  - body
  - metadata (jsonb)
  - created_at, updated_at

Indexes & Constraints
- Unique index on `users.email`
- FK constraint `notes.user_id` -> `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE

Migration Strategy
- Use Prisma Migrate or TypeORM migrations committed to version control
- Local development: run `docker-compose up -d` then `npm run migrate` which applies migrations to the Postgres container
- CI: run migrations in a disposable test DB before running integration tests

Seeding
- Provide optional seed scripts for demo users and sample notes

Backups & Production
- Recommend scheduled logical backups (pg_dump) and WAL archiving as a long-term plan


```

```markdown
---
title: DevOps, Local Development, and CI
---

Docker Compose
- The repository root will contain a `docker-compose.yml` that defines:
  - `postgres` service (image: postgres:15)
  - `pgadmin` or admin tool (optional)
  - `db-migrations` helper service (optional) to run migrations

Environment
- Use `.env` files with safe defaults for local development and reference them in `docker-compose.yml`
- Keep secrets out of the repository; provide a `.env.example` with variables

CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions (or other) with workflows:
  - `ci.yml`: installs dependencies, runs lint, unit tests, runs migrations against a test DB container, runs integration tests
  - `release.yml`: builds images, tags, and optionally publishes to registry

Testing
- Use a disposable Postgres container in CI for integration tests; run migrations before tests
- Use `nx` affected tests to limit test surface in PRs

Logging & Observability
- Use structured JSON logging from the API
- Provide a basic Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint (optional)

Local Developer Quickstart
1. Install Node 18+, Docker
2. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`
3. docker-compose up -d
4. npm install
5. nx serve api
6. nx serve frontend


```

```dockercompose
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: agility
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

I'll fix the Markdown linter warnings by editing the plan files to add required blank lines and a code-fence language; I'll read the files first then apply edits.

  - `apps/frontend` — React application (Vite or Next.js depending on SSR needs; default: Vite for simplicity)

  - `apps/api` — NestJS REST API (TypeScript)

Libraries

- `libs/shared` — DTOs, types, and shared utils used by both frontend and backend

- `libs/db` — database access layer, entities, and migration utilities

- `libs/ui` — shared UI components (optional)

Tooling

- Node 18+; TypeScript; ESLint; Prettier; Jest/Playwright

- NX task orchestration for building, serving, linting, and testing

├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   └── api/
└── libs/
    ├── shared/
    ├── db/
    └── ui/
```

Rationale

- Monorepo enables sharing DTOs and types between frontend and backend reducing duplication and integration errors.

- NX provides caching, task orchestration, and efficient builds for large workspaces.


CI/CD note

- CI pipelines should run tests in parallel per app and use NX affected graph to minimize work.

title: Features and User Stories
---


Overview

- This document lists the initial feature set and user stories for the first release. Each story includes a brief acceptance criterion.

Core Features

1. User management

   - As a user, I can register an account, log in, and log out.

   - Acceptance: Users can create an account and authenticate; JWT tokens issued by API.

2. Profile management

   - As a user, I can update my profile information and upload an avatar.

   - Acceptance: Changes persist in DB; avatar upload stores file reference.

3. Simple resource CRUD (e.g., Notes)

   - As a user, I can create, read, update, and delete notes tied to my account.

   - Acceptance: Notes are scoped to user and accessible via API and frontend.

4. Authorization rules

   - As the system, only the owner can modify their resources.

   - Acceptance: API returns 403 for unauthorized modifications.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: p95 API latency < 200ms under baseline test load

- Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt; JWTs signed with RS256

- Observability: Request logs and basic metrics (requests/sec, error rate)

Edge Cases

- Rate limits for create endpoints

- Handling partial failures during file upload


Roadmap & Prioritization

- Phase 1: Auth + User CRUD + DB schema

- Phase 2: Notes CRUD + UI integration

- Phase 3: Polish, tests, and deployment

title: Database Schema & Migrations
---


Overview

- PostgreSQL will be used as the primary relational datastore. Migrations will be managed with `knex`, `typeorm`, or `prisma` (recommendation: Prisma for DX and TypeScript-first models).

Entities (initial)

- `users`:

  - id (uuid, PK)

  - email (unique)

  - password_hash

  - display_name

  - avatar_url

  - created_at, updated_at

- `notes`:

  - id (uuid, PK)

  - user_id (FK -> users.id)

  - title

  - body

  - metadata (jsonb)

  - created_at, updated_at

Indexes & Constraints

- Unique index on `users.email`

- FK constraint `notes.user_id` -> `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE

Migration Strategy

- Use Prisma Migrate or TypeORM migrations committed to version control

- Local development: run `docker-compose up -d` then `npm run migrate` which applies migrations to the Postgres container

- CI: run migrations in a disposable test DB before running integration tests

Seeding

- Provide optional seed scripts for demo users and sample notes


Backups & Production

- Recommend scheduled logical backups (pg_dump) and WAL archiving as a long-term plan
 
```

title: DevOps, Local Development, and CI
---


Docker Compose

- The repository root will contain a `docker-compose.yml` that defines:

  - `postgres` service (image: postgres:15)

  - `pgadmin` or admin tool (optional)

  - `db-migrations` helper service (optional) to run migrations

Environment

- Use `.env` files with safe defaults for local development and reference them in `docker-compose.yml`

- Keep secrets out of the repository; provide a `.env.example` with variables

CI/CD

- Use GitHub Actions (or other) with workflows:

  - `ci.yml`: installs dependencies, runs lint, unit tests, runs migrations against a test DB container, runs integration tests

  - `release.yml`: builds images, tags, and optionally publishes to registry

Testing

- Use a disposable Postgres container in CI for integration tests; run migrations before tests

- Use `nx` affected tests to limit test surface in PRs

Logging & Observability

- Use structured JSON logging from the API

- Provide a basic Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint (optional)

Local Developer Quickstart

1. Install Node 18+, Docker

2. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`

3. docker-compose up -d

4. npm install

5. nx serve api


6. nx serve frontend

Status update: I created the `plan/` folder with `plan.md`, `architecture.md`, `features.md`, `database.md`, and `devops.md`, added a root `docker-compose.yml`, ran linter checks, and fixed formatting warnings. All planned TODOs are now completed.

Summary:
- Added `plan/plan.md`, `plan/architecture.md`, `plan/features.md`, `plan/database.md`, `plan/devops.md`.
- Added `docker-compose.yml` at repo root defining PostgreSQL service.
- Ensured files pass markdown linting (fixed spacing and formatting warnings).
- Marked all plan-related todos as completed.

What next? I can:
- Scaffold the NX workspace and initial apps (`apps/frontend`, `apps/api`, `libs/*`) and commit the initial project files.
- Generate & configure Prisma schema + initial migration.
- Create GitHub Actions CI scaffolding.
Which of these should I do next?
