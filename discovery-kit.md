# Product Discovery Kit

This repo contains an experimental **Product Discovery Kit** that works alongside [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).  
The goal: help you figure out **what to build** (product discovery, architecture, roadmap), then hand off clean stubs for **how to build** (Spec Kit features).

markdown
Copy code

- `.cursor/commands/ideate.md`  
- `.cursor/commands/validate.md`  
- `.cursor/commands/prioritize.md`  
- `.cursor/commands/roadmap.md`  
- `.cursor/commands/handoff.md`  

Each command is written in the same style as Spec Kit commands.

## ðŸš¦ Workflow

1. **Start broad**
   - In Cursor, run:  
     ```
     /ideate Explore product ideas for [problem or opportunity].
     ```
   - Results are saved to `plan/ideation.md`.

2. **Validate**
   - In Cursor:  
     ```
     /validate Score the ideas in plan/ideation.md against feasibility, desirability, and viability.
     ```
   - Results go into `plan/validation.md`.

3. **Prioritize**
   - In Cursor:  
     ```
     /prioritize Rank the validated ideas by constraints (budget, timeline, impact).
     ```
   - Results are written to `plan/priorities.md`.

4. **Create roadmap**
   - In Cursor:  
     ```
     /roadmap Turn plan/priorities.md into a phased roadmap.
     ```
   - Results are written to `plan/roadmap.md`.

5. **Handoff to Spec Kit**
   - In Cursor:  
     ```
     /handoff Generate feature spec stubs from plan/roadmap.md
     ```
   - Creates files under `plan/spec-feed/` like `001-user-authentication.md`.  
   - Each stub is ready to be pulled into Spec Kit: `/clarify â†’ /plan â†’ /tasks â†’ /implement`.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Points
- **No overwrites**: commands only add new plan files or stubs, never replace existing ones.  
- **Spec Feed**: the bridge between Discovery Kit and Spec Kit.  
- **Consistency**: all artifacts are Markdown, version-controlled, and evolve with the project.

## âœ… Example

- Start with a vague idea:  
/ideate Build something to help dog trainers manage agility titles.

markdown
Copy code

- Follow the workflow â†’ youâ€™ll end up with:  
- `plan/roadmap.md` showing phases,  
- `plan/spec-feed/001-agility-tracker.md` as a stub,  
- Then feed that stub into Spec Kit (`/clarify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`) to generate code.

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps
- Use this kit to capture your product thinking.  
- When ready, pass the stubs to Spec Kit for implementation.  
- Iterate: update `ideation.md`, re-run `/validate`, `/prioritize`, `/roadmap`, and `/handoff` as product ide
